the height of pistons can now be calculated using vector equations that wa found on robot kinematics tutorial videos

the piston heights match the ones generated before when the z-coordinate of the plane was given. the additional feature I get is that now i can control the angle at which the plane slants with the help of a 3x3 rotaiontal matrix. for parallel operation it is set as a identity matrix.

the rotational matrix is found out be XY eulers angles
