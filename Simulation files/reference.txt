calculating eulerXY angles from azimuth and altitude angles:

consider the plane in its initial position with zero altitude angle or parallel to XY-plane
the final position of the plane is facing the sun at some azimuthor altitude angles
if we consider the final and initial opstions of the panel as two cordinates systems, the final postion is obtained after the euler tranformation of x and y axises respectively
the movement of the unit normal vector of the plane is taken into consideration
let the initial cordinates of the normal vector be x,y & z
after euler trasformation  the final cordinates are taken as X,Y & Z
the final coordinates are obtained after matrix multipllication of initial cordiantes with the rotational matrix, the final rotational matrix is obtained after multiplying Rx(theta_x) and Ry(theta_y), where theta_x and theta_y are angles rotated through each axis respectively.
source for notes on 3d Rotation_matrix: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix
the initial and final coordiantes are written as a 1 x 3 matrix
[X Y Z]T = RxRy . [x y z]T 
after close observation its found that the final postion of panel is such that the z axis doesn't change and and the normal lies on the  - axis, hence the X and Y cordinates are zero.
hence the changing the equation to [0 0 Z]T = RxRy . [x y z]T
from equating the first and second rows we have obtained the equation for converting x,y & z to euler X & Y angles.

These coordinates can be easily obtained from the given azimuth and altitude angles.

x = cos(azimuthAngle)

y = sin(azimuthAngle)

z = tan(altitudeAngle)
